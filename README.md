# Navigation SDK

When your users want to get from one location to another, donâ€™t push them out of your application into a generic map application.
Instead, keep them engaged with your application 100% of the time with in-app turn-by-turn navigation.

The Navigation SDK for Android contains logic needed to get timed navigation instructions.

It plays well with the open source [GraphHopper server](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/tree/master/navigation) as well as the [GraphHopper Directions API](https://www.graphhopper.com/products/).
